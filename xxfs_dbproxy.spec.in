%description
xxfs_dbproxy is a derivative of the MySql-Proxy project.  However this project
greatly differs in the respect it is designed to act like a database in itself as opposed to just a proxy.  xxfs_dbproxy allows database designers to partition
data across multiple MySQL databases and allow simple (currently) commands to
be sent to one or more databases and those results to be consolidated.  Instead
of using LUA like MySQL-Proxy we have developed most of the code in 'C' and the
spirit of the project is to make a library that will support many of the 
functions MySQL is attempting to support but with performance in mind.
